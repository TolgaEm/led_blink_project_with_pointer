#  led_blink_project_with_pointer
## STM32F4 Project

** we used STM32F407VG discovery board and referrence manual **

** also in this project used Keil Uvision ide and toolchain **

** we used only pointer variable and memory manupulation **

** in my opinnion this sample is very useful for understanding pointer capability in embedded project and programing language **
